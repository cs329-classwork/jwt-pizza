# Incident: YYYY-MM-DD HH-mm-ss

## Summary

```md
Between the hour of 16:55 UTC and 17:00 UTC on 2025-04-08, 3 users encountered errors when trying to order pizzas. The event was triggered by failures in a 3rd party system at 09:55.

Severity: **SEVERE**
```

## Detection

```md
By matter of extreme luck, Blake McGhie (a team member) was looking at the dashboard when the incident occurred, and was able to respond immediately. 

The incident was resolved before our alert rules triggered. We have adjusted the alert rules to trigger sooner, in case the same problem were to occur again.
```

## Impact

```md
For 5 minutes between {16:55 UTC and 17:00 UTC} on {04/08/25}, our users experienced this incident.

0 Support Tickets were submitted.
```

## Timeline

```md
All times are UTC.

- _16:58_ - Blake McGhie noticed some unusual failures in the dashboard when users tried to create pizzas.
- _16:59_ - Blake McGhie looked in the logs for failed pizza creations, and submitted a bug report to the 3rd party jwt pizza factory using the link provided in their api response.
- _17:00_ - Metrics confirm that pizza creations stabilized and were no longer unsuccesful.

```

## Root cause

```md
The 3rd party pizza factory began to fail when making calls to create a pizza. Our system relies on this service heavily, and we do not have a backup in case that system fails.
```

## Resolution

```md
By submitting a bug report to the 3rd party pizza factory, they became aware of the issue and the issue was resolved very quickly.

This was confirmed using our metrics dashboard for JWT Pizza on Grafana. Our engineer also manually tested the endpoint via our UI to eliminate any doubt.
```

## Action items

```md
1. Reduce failure points by having our application switch pizza factory services if the main one starts to fail.
2. Adjust alert trigger rules to fire earlier in case the same issue occurs again. (DONE)
